Hi, I'm Alex,

00:00:02.446 --> 00:00:05.326
the sales manager for emerging markets here at Simple.

00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:10.359
We've been working with one of our most challenging
clients, Level Corp, on a major deal.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:15.896
Everything was on track until yesterday, when they
raised concerns about pricing and delivery timelines.

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:19.740
As the sales representative, it's your task now to
engage them.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.766
This project could be a major source of revenue,
so how you respond, and how you show up, really matters.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:31.978
You can choose how to begin the conversation with
Jamie, our primary contact at Level, by selecting

00:00:31.978 --> 00:00:35.507
email, text, or video chat from the apps on the left.

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:41.294
I'll be here below throughout the conversation, giving
you real-time feedback as you interact with Jamie.
